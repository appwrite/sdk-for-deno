**This SDK is compatible with Appwrite server version 0.15.x. For older versions, please check [previous releases](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-deno/releases).**

Appwrite is an open-source backend as a service server that abstract and simplify complex and repetitive development tasks behind a very simple to use REST API. Appwrite aims to help you develop your apps faster and in a more secure way. Use the Deno SDK to integrate your app with the Appwrite server to easily start interacting with all of Appwrite backend APIs and tools. For full API documentation and tutorials go to [https://appwrite.io/docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)

## Installation

```javascript
import * as sdk from "https://deno.land/x/appwrite/mod.ts";
```


## Getting Started

### Init your SDK
Initialize your SDK with your Appwrite server API endpoint and project ID which can be found in your project settings page and your new API secret Key from project's API keys section.

```typescript
let client = new sdk.Client();

client
    .setEndpoint('https://[HOSTNAME_OR_IP]/v1') // Your API Endpoint
    .setProject('5df5acd0d48c2') // Your project ID
    .setKey('919c2d18fb5d4...a2ae413da83346ad2') // Your secret API key
    .setSelfSigned() // Use only on dev mode with a self-signed SSL cert
;
```

### Make your first request

Once your SDK object is set, create any of the Appwrite service objects and choose any request to send. Full documentation for any service method you would like to use can be found in your SDK documentation or in the [API References](https://appwrite.io/docs) section.

```typescript
let users = new sdk.Users(client);

let response = await users.create('[USER_ID]', 'email@example.com', 'password');
console.log(response);
```

### Full Example
```typescript
import * as sdk from "https://deno.land/x/appwrite/mod.ts";

let client = new sdk.Client();
let users = new sdk.Users(client);

client
    .setEndpoint('https://[HOSTNAME_OR_IP]/v1') // Your API Endpoint
    .setProject('5df5acd0d48c2') // Your project ID
    .setKey('919c2d18fb5d4...a2ae413da83346ad2') // Your secret API key
    .setSelfSigned() // Use only on dev mode with a self-signed SSL cert
;

let response = await users.create('[USER_ID]', 'email@example.com', 'password');
console.log(response);
```

### Error Handling
The Appwrite Deno SDK raises `AppwriteException` object with `message`, `code` and `response` properties. You can handle any errors by catching `AppwriteException` and present the `message` to the user or handle it yourself based on the provided error information. Below is an example.

```typescript
let users = new sdk.Users(client);

try {
    let response = await users.create('[USER_ID]', 'email@example.com', 'password');
} catch(e) {
    console.log(e.message);
}
```
